WIKI API Project
Contributers: Spencer Marsh, Jacob Richardson, and Ethan Davis 

Our planning documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2GrIjPEP7-bta0XGFCoBchsBkQKxRRIaaJmfjpQndk/edit?usp=sharing

This API is designed to to organize information similiar to Wiki. 
Information will be sorted into topics that will have a table of contents and a list of more detailed subcontents.
Our project utilizes an n-tier architecture. This API could be a helpful companion to the frontend development of a UI, that could display text-based information in an organized manner. 
Cloning this project would allow users to read, create, edit, and delete topics and its contents with Swagger or Postman.
